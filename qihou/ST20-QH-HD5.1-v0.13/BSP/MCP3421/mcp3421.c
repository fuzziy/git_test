* 1. Data rate options
*   3.75 SPS(18bits)
*   15   SPS(16bits)
*   60   SPS(14bits)
*   140  SPS(12bits)
*
* 2. MCP3421 have only 1 config register
*   bit 7   RDY: Ready Bit
*             This bit is the data ready flag. In read mode, this bit indicates 
*             if the output register has been updated with a new conversion. 
*             In One-Shot Conversion mode, writing this bit to ¡°1¡± initiates 
*             a new conversion.
*             
*             Reading RDY bit with the read command:
*             1 = Output register has not been updated.
*             0 = Output register has been updated with the latest conversion data.
*             
*             Writing RDY bit with the write command:
*             Continuous Conversion mode: No effect
*             One-Shot Conversion mode:
*             1 = Initiate a new conversion.
*             0 = No effect.
*   bit 6-5   C1-C0: Channel Selection Bits
*             These are the Channel Selection bits, but not used in the MCP3421 device.
*   bit 4 O/C: Conversion Mode Bit
*             1 = Continuous Conversion Mode. Once this bit is selected, the device 
*                 performs data conversion continuously.
*             0 = One-Shot Conversion Mode. The device performs a single conversion 
*                 and enters a low power standby mode until it receives another 
*                 write/read command.
*   bit 3-2 S1-S0: Sample Rate Selection Bit
*           00 = 240 SPS (12 bits),
*           01 = 60 SPS (14 bits),
*           10 = 15 SPS (16 bits),
*           11 = 3.75 SPS (18 bits)
*   bit 1-0 G1-G0: PGA Gain Selector Bits
*           00 = 1 V/V,
*           01 = 2 V/V,
*           10 = 4 V/V,
*           11 = 8 V/V
